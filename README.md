# Telegram Summon Button

My code for an ESP32 project to have Telegram send a notification to my phone when a button is pressed on my desk at work, allowing me to become aware someone is looking for me from anywhere in the building as I currently manage a decent sized warehouse by myself with an upstairs and downstairs.

Already have plans to expand the code dramatically and allow for the user to type 'slash commands' to the bot to reply back and send text to the LCD and also have a green and red led I can turn on and off to respond with as well to say if I'm busy or not.
